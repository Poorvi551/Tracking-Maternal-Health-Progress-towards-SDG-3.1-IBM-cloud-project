Problem statement:

Tracking Maternal Health Progress Toward SDG 3.1: A Global Data Analysis

The Challenge:

The Sustainable Development Goal 3.1 aims to reduce the global maternal mortality 
ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030. Monitoring progress towards this 
goal requires analyzing country-wise data on maternal mortality and associated health 
indicators such as antenatal care coverage, births attended by skilled personnel, 
adolescent birth rates, and healthcare expenditures. Despite global efforts, maternal 
health outcomes vary drastically between regions and income groups, raising the need 
for data-driven insights into the factors influencing maternal health.
